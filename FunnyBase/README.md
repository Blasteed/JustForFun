# FunnyBase

A ".txt" database creator and manager (using "\t" characters to control the base) where store your informations, starting from py (one of my favourites). Comments will make you be able to read the code without problems. Everything you need (as libraries), are already installed inside the source directory. The script will create a "system_files" directory where will store the files and the bases.
